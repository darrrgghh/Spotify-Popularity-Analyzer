# 🎧 Spotify Popularity Analyzer

**Version: 0.5**

This is a desktop Python application for analyzing the popularity of artists' releases on Spotify. It uses the Spotify API and allows you to:

- Search for artists  
- Browse their discographies
- View the popularity of all and each release, as well as tracks (with graphs)  
- Filter releases by keywords (e.g., `live`, `remastered`, `demo`)  
- Export popular albums and tracks to a text file  
- Manually exclude unwanted releases  
- Log in using your own Spotify API keys  
- Log out to remove saved credentials

3. Enter an artist name and click **Search**  
4. Select the desired artist and explore their data  
5. Use the **File → Export Popularity...** menu to export data  
6. Open **Settings** to adjust filters and the number of albums/tracks to export
