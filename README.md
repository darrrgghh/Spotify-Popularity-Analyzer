# Spotify Popularity Analyzer

**Version: 0.5**

This is a desktop Python application for analyzing the popularity of artists' releases on Spotify. It uses the Spotify API and allows you to:

- Search for artists  
- Browse their discographies
- View the popularity of all and each release, as well as tracks (with graphs)  
- Filter releases by keywords (e.g., `live`, `remastered`, `demo`)  
- Export popular albums and tracks to a text file  
- Manually exclude unwanted releases  
- Log in using your own Spotify API keys  
- Log out to remove saved credentials

## How to Use

1. Get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)  
2. On first launch, the app will ask for your credentials and save them to `.spotify_credentials`  
3. Enter an artist name and click **Search**  
4. Select the desired artist and explore their data  
5. Use the **File â†’ Export Popularity...** menu to export data  
6. Open **Settings** to adjust filters and the number of albums/tracks to export

## Building Executables

### Windows:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole popularity.py --hidden-import=spotipy
```


### macOS:

1. Make sure `pyinstaller` is installed:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build using the provided popularity.spec file (recommended):

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed popularity.py --hidden-import=spotipy
```
Alternatively, you can build manually like this:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed popularity.py --hidden-import=spotipy
```

3. Run the resulting file from `dist/`:

> If blocked by macOS Gatekeeper, allow the app in **System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security**.
